This is my webserver written completely in C and meant to also be compatible with JOS, the OS I wrote.

As far as security goes, I don't currently do any explicit sandboxing in my code but I do have some
basic checks to make sure nothing fishy is happeneing. It's definitely not good enough but I'll fix
that once the webserver meets my standards of functionality.
